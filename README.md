msLDAPDump simplifies LDAP enumeration in a domain environment by wrapping the lpap3 library from Python in an easy-to-use interface. 

### Binding Anonymously



Users can bind to LDAP anonymously through the tool and dump basic information about LDAP, including domain naming context, domain controller hostnames, and more.
